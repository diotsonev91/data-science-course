    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This project addresses the problem of **fruit image classification under constrained conditions**, such as limited training data and deployment on resource-limited devices. We investigate whether compact **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** trained on **grayscale inputs** can deliver competitive accuracy while requiring less memory and compute compared to established models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach includes training a **lightweight custom CNN** on a small grayscale fruit dataset and comparing its performance to **MobileNetV2**, a widely used pretrained model. We evaluate models in terms of **accuracy, model size, and inference speed**, with a focus on suitability for **edge deployment**. To further optimize efficiency, we apply **post-training quantization** (float32 → int8) to compress the CNN and reduce inference latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimental results show that **grayscale CNNs can achieve accuracy close to RGB-based baselines**, with significant savings in computational cost. **MobileNetV2** delivers higher accuracy but at the expense of larger size and slower inference on CPU. **Quantization reduces model size by up to ~75% with minimal accuracy loss**, making the lightweight CNN more practical for embedded and mobile use.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings highlight the **trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency** in vision tasks, demonstrating how compact CNNs can support real-world applications of **edge-ready deep learning** in agriculture and food automation.\n"

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on the task of classifying images of fruits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The primary goal is to explore how image classification can be effectively achieved under **constrained conditions**, such as **limited data availability** and **resource-limited deployment environments** (e.g., embedded systems or smartphones).\n",
    "\n",
    "Image classification is widely used in applications like automated food sorting, agricultural monitoring, quality control, and retail automation. Efficient and accurate classification systems can significantly reduce manual labor, increase throughput, and ensure consistency across vision-based workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we aim to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build and train a **lightweight CNN** capable of classifying fruit images using **grayscale input**.\n",
    "- Apply **lightweight grayscale-specific augmentations** (e.g., flips, small rotations, noise) only to training data, to improve robustness without violating low-data constraints.\n",
    "- Optimize for **small model size and fast inference**, making the model suitable for edge deployment.\n",
    "- Compare the performance of our lightweight CNN with a **well-known pretrained model (MobileNetV2)** to understand trade-offs in accuracy, size, and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of This Project\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Data-Efficient Design  \n",
    "  We work with a **small dataset** and **grayscale images**, using **minimal augmentations** to improve generalization while simulating real-world data scarcity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Deployment-Ready Modeling  \n",
    "  The CNN architecture is selected and trained to support **low-power, real-time inference** on embedded hardware or mobile devices. Post-training, we apply **quantization** (float32 → int8) to reduce memory and latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Comparative Evaluation  \n",
    "  We benchmark our model against a **pretrained MobileNetV2**, comparing trade-offs between size, accuracy, and complexity in a deployment context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Transparent Experimentation  \n",
    "  All preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps are clearly explained and reproducible, with detailed tracking of accuracy and inference performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "By exploring how far a compact CNN can go under tight constraints, this project contributes to the field of **edge-ready deep learning** — enabling smart, efficient vision systems even where compute and data are scarce.\n"
